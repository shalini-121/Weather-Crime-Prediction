# Weather-Crime-Prediction
Project Overview

This repository hosts a machine learning project focused on exploring the potential of weather conditions and temporal patterns to predict crime occurrences using the powerful XGBoost algorithm. The project aims to understand if environmental factors and time-based cues can offer valuable insights for anticipating crime trends, ultimately supporting more proactive and data-driven policing strategies.

Motivation

Traditional crime management often reacts to past events. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to uncover subtle relationships between environmental factors (like temperature and rainfall) and crime, enabling a more predictive approach to resource allocation and crime prevention.

Features
Weather-Crime Correlation Analysis: Investigates the influence of temperature, rainfall, and other weather attributes on crime rates.

Temporal Pattern Recognition: Analyzes how time-based features (hour of day, day of week, month of year) correlate with crime.

XGBoost Predictive Modeling: Utilizes the robust XGBoost algorithm for building a high-performance regression model.

Synthetic Data Generation: Includes a module for generating synthetic crime and weather data, enabling methodological development even without immediate access to real-world datasets.

Feature Engineering: Demonstrates the creation of informative features from raw temporal and weather data.

Model Evaluation: Provides comprehensive evaluation metrics (MSE, R-squared, MAE, Accuracy) to assess model performance.

Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies the key features most influential in the model's predictions.
